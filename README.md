To access the evironment variables you need to make a nodemon.json file in your local system
add environment variables in the format 
{
  "env": {
             "Variable Name": "Variable value",
             "Variable_name" "Variable_value"
              
         }
}

finally dont forget to add it into your git ignore 
including nodemodules
